      - If there is one with another value, store state type event with value "CreatingIssue" and continue to creating issue
  - if State = "CreatingIssue"
    - Get 1 event of type "CreatingIssue"
      - If none, ask the user if they would like to create a Github Issue for this? Store a "CreatingIssue" type event with value ["QUERYING"]
